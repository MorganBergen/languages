**description**  
in this course, we will explore, formal syntactic and semantic descriptions, compilation and implementation issues, and theoretical foundations for several programming paradigms.  programming languages are one of the most important and direct tools for the construction of a computer system: in a modern computer, different languages are routinely used for different levels of abstraction. programming language is important because it defines the relationship, semantics, and grammar which allows the programmers to effectively communicate with the machines that they program.

**objectives**  
| # | description |
|:-----------|:-------------|
| 1 | given a regular expression, dicern if a string matches a regular expression |
| 2 | given a context-free grammar, write a program to parse another program written following the context-free grammar |
| 3 | follow semantic rules to determine whether a sentence in a program has semantic meaning |
| 4 |  in a programming language, given a line, determine a definitive semantic meaning |
| 5 | navigate a typed system & determine type equivalence, recover unknown types through polymorphism, & determine type errors |
| 6 | use lambda calculus |
| 7 | amnipulate stack, heap, & memory at runtime |

**midterm exam**  
will be hosted after module 3

**final exam**  
will be hosted after module 6

**course assessments**  
The course assessments will be weighted as follows:

Projects– 30%
There are 3 Projects over the course of the session, each can be accessed and reviewed at the beginning of the class. Please complete them when you have enough information to properly engage with the content. Project 1 covers Modules 1-3. Project 2 covers Modules 3-5. Project 3 is hard and covers Modules 5-6. Due dates are listed in the Course Summary below.

Practice Quizzes - 0%
There are practice quizzes at the end of each week, these are optional and will not be calculated into your final grade. 

Homework – 20%
There are two homeworks in this course, each will be available at the beginning of the course and should be completed as soon as you have enough information to be successful. Due dates are listed in the Course Summary below.

Midterm – 20%
The Midterm exam will be monitored using Lockdown Browser. Please be aware that no exceptions will be made, the proctoring is required. 

Final – 30%
The test will be available in the final week of the course.
