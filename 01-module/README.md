## 01.0 - overview  

**overview**

lexical analysis is the process of checking the syntac of a given programming language.  in lexical analysis, regular expressions are used as a way to represent the tokens of a programming language.  longest matching prefix rule says that if there are more than one match, the longest match should be returned and is a way of resolving ambiguity when there are multiple matches. 

**outcomes/objectives**

1.  explain what lexical analysis is
2.  describe what regular expressions are
3.  describe the language of a regular expression
4.  describe the concatenation of kleene star operator of regular expressions
5.  write regular expressions for a given token
6.  apply the longest matching prefix rule

## 01.1 - lexical analysis: language and syntax  

overview of programming languages.

what is a programming language, how does it work, and how does the computer know what to do?  view the following powerpoint to learn more.

###  what is a programming language

-  a structured way to define computation
-  is it the only definition /  purpose?
    -  communicate an algorithm
    -  describe a process
    -  communicate a system to another person
    -  communicate instructions to a machine

###  how does the computer understand your instructions

the cpu understands assembly language

-  programs translate your intentions to the assembly language that the cpu understands
-  compilers
    -  translate programming language to executable binary
-  interpreters
    -  understand a programming language and perform the actual computation
-  transpilers
    -  translate a programming language to another programming language

###  how do they work

-  in this class we will study how these programs are able to translate a high level programming language into something the computer can understand

-  theory
    -  enables us to define what we can do and cannot do when defining a programming language
-  practice
    -  empowers us to develop domain specific languages, task specific compilers, static analysis, parsing...

###  compiler

compiler converts high level code into machine code (well not really)

relative references for functions define in your code

symbolic references for functions not defined in your code

<img src="./compiler.svg" alt="compiler" style="width: 400px;"/>

###  relocation

-  table of pointers to lines of code that need linking to different libraries
    -  the symbolic references
-  a symbol table is also created in this step, which has information about the symbols and what functions have to be loaded for a given symbol.
-  

###  linker

uses relation table to find lines of code to be replaced and then uses the symbol tables to find which functions have to be used.

<img src="./table.svg" alt="table" style="width: 400px;"/>

1.  create 1 output binary (merged), start at 0
2.  fix all local references with global relative addresses
3.  fix all symbolic refs

###  loader

<img src="./loader.svg" alt="loader" style="width: 400px;"/>

takes the output of linker and copies them to memory

<img src="./0-loader.svg" alt="0-loader" style="width: 400px;"/>

###  create a process

-  process control blocks `pcb`
   -  process id
   -  process counter = start address of code
   -  status register
-  put the `pcb` in the ready queue

###  overview of program interpretation

<img src="./interpretation.svg" alt="interpretation" style="width: 400px;"/>

###  what makes a program valid?

1.  **syntax**  what does it mean to look like a valid program?
2.  **semantics**  what does it mean for a program to be valid?
3.  **correctness**  is the program the correct one for the job?

lexical analysis

a programming language must have a clearly specified syntax.  lexical analysis is the process of checking the syntax of a given programming language.  refer to the lexical analysis powerpoint and watch the video below for more information.

## 01.2 - lexical analysis: regular expressions  

in lexical analysis, regular expressions are used as a way to represent tokens of a programming language

## 01.3 - lexical analysis: concatenation  

concatenation operation on regular expressions is defined as 

$L \left( R_{1} . R_{2} \right) = L \left( R_{1} . R_{2} \right)$

$R_1 \cdot R_2 = \{ xy \mid x \in R_1 \text{ and } y \in R_2 \}$

## 01.4 - lexical analysis: kleene star  

kleene star operator is an operation performed on regular expressions.  it is denoted as

$L \left( R^{*}\right) . \; L \left(R^{*} \right)= \{ \varepsilon \} \; \cup \; L\left(R\right) \cup \; L\left( R \right) . \; L\left( R \right) \cup L\left( R \right) . \; L\left( R \right) . \; L\left( R \right) \cup \cdots$

## 01.5 - lexical analysis: regular expression examples  

in this video we will see some examples of how regular expressions are used.

## 01.6 - lexical analysis: longest matching prefix rule  

longst matching prefix rule says that if there are more than one match, the longest match should be returned.  this is a way of resolving ambiguity when there are multiple matches.

## 01.7 - practice quiz  

the questions in this quiz are derived from the content presented in module 1.  the practice quiz is intended as a knowledge check for mastery of objectives in this module.  it provides a sample of questions you will see in the midterm exam for the course.

1.  consider the following code

```c++
Token LexicalAnalyzer::GetToken() {
    input.GetChar(c);
    switch (c) {
        case '=':
            input.GetChar(c);
            if (c == '=') {
                tmp.token_type = EQEQ;
            } else if
    }
}
```
